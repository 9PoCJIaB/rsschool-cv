I am 28 years old, and I work as a ventilation engineer. Now I live in St. Petersburg.
But in the near future I plan to move to the EU. I am currently learning English with a tutor and on my own with Duolingo.
At the moment I will combine my studies with work, but in the future I will try to devote myself to learning and practice.
I will master the acquired skills in order to use them in my work.
